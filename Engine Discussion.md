**Game Maker**

* Advantages
  * Easy to use
  * Simple creation and use of assests
  * Programming and drag and drop
  * It works quite well with github (I think)
  
* Disadvantages
  * Some files may not be directly sharable on git (Not sure)
  * Own syntax (easy to learn though)
  * Free version would not be viable for this project as it only accepts 10 different objects
  (Though pro or the next version up was offered for free for a while, not sure if everyone got it, might still be obtainable)
